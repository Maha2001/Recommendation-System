# E-commerce Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

A customer specific product recommendation system built using matrix factorization and collaborative filtering to predict customer preferences based on past purchase behaviour.

## Key Objectives

- Develop a recommendation engine for an e-commerce dataset using collaborative filtering.
- Provide customer specific product recommendations based on customerâ€™s past purchases.
- Build a deployable API using Flask to enable real-time recommendations.

## Methodology

Matrix factorization, a popular collaborative filtering technique, to capture latent relationships between users and products is used here. This involves:

1. Encoding customer and product IDs to integer indices.
2. Training a neural network model to learn low-dimensional embeddings.
3. Predicting interaction scores based on dot product of user and product embeddings.

## Model Pipeline

### Data Preprocessing

- Load the e-commerce dataset.
- Drop missing values and convert quantity to integer.
- Encode Customer Id and Product using LabelEncoder.

### Model Definition

- A PyTorch-based matrix factorization model with embedding layers for users and products.

### Training

- Train on quantity of items purchased using Mean Squared Error loss.
- Save the model as model.pth.

### Serving via Flask API

- `/recommend` endpoint accepts a user ID and returns top-N product recommendations.

## Challenges Addressed

- More importance to frequently occurring customer-product interactions to avoid cold start issues.
- Dimensionality reduction is used to handle limited user-item interaction matrix.
- Scalable Pipeline designed using PyTorch and Flask for easy integration. 

## Results

- The model showed strong convergence during training: Loss reduced from 7122.28 to 89.53 over 10 epochs.
- Accurate and relevant product recommendations are generated for known/ repetitive customers.
- Fast inference time enables real-time responses from the Flask API.

## Impact

This model can be integrated into any e-commerce platform to:

- Enhance cutomer experience through personalization.
- Boost engagement and conversions.
- Reduce less engagement of customers by showing relevant products.
